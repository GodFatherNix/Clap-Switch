Clap Switch
A simple sound-activated switch that turns a device on or off when you clap. It uses a microphone to detect sound and a basic transistor-based circuit to toggle the output.

Files Included

Notes
This is a basic learning project for sound detection and switching.
Can be used to control small devices like LEDs or relays.
